# Wisdom of the crowd with our robotic overlord

To chat with ChatGPT, simply create a new [issue](https://github.com/second-state/chat-with-chatgpt/issues) with your question. ChatGPT will then respond to anyone's question in the comments thread under that issue.

Keep in mind that the conversation will reset to a new start if there is no new comment in the thread for ten minutes.

This GitHub app is powered by the [GPT3.5 model](https://openai.com/blog/introducing-chatgpt-and-whisper-apis), Rust, and [WasmEdge](https://github.com/WasmEdge/WasmEdge).

If you'd like to deploy this GitHub App in your own orgnization, please find our email by visiting our profile and send an email to us.
