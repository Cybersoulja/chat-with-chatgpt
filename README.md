# Wisdom of the crowd with our robotic overlord

To start, [simply create a new issue](https://github.com/second-state/chat-with-chatgpt/issues/new) and ask your question **as a comment**. ChatGPT will then respond to anyone's question in the comments thread under that issue. [See all conversation threads](https://github.com/second-state/chat-with-chatgpt/issues).

> Keep in mind that the conversation will reset to a new start if there is no new comment in the thread for ten minutes.

## Why do this?

This repo allows multiple people to chat with ChatGPT collaboratively in the open. The diversity of opinions is key to the growth of the AI. There is no secret prompts. All chat messages and prompts are public and tracked by GitHub.
