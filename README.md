# Chat with Chatgpt

To chat with ChatGPT, simply create a new issue and anyone can join in. Keep in mind that conversations will expire if there are no new messages for ten minutes.

This GitHub app is powered by [GPT3.5 model](https://openai.com/blog/introducing-chatgpt-and-whisper-apis), Rust, and [WasmEdge](https://github.com/WasmEdge/WasmEdge).


The source code is coming soon.
