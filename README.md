# Wisdom of the crowd with our robotic overlord

To chat with ChatGPT, simply create a new issue with your question in issue comments under this repo and anyone can join in. Keep in mind that conversations will reset to a new start if there is no new message for ten minutes.

This GitHub app is powered by [GPT3.5 model](https://openai.com/blog/introducing-chatgpt-and-whisper-apis), Rust, and [WasmEdge](https://github.com/WasmEdge/WasmEdge).
